    <string name="dataset_information">
        This app uses the Open Images Dataset (Version 6) to get image download URLs, bounding boxes
        to crop the pictures to, and classifications of the bounding boxes.
    </string>

    <string name="instructions_description">
        A random image from the dataset will be chosen and you must guess the correct classification
        out of four options.
        Sometimes, there can be multiple answers (for example, a human head can be classified as
        <b>Face</b> or <b>Human Hair</b>) and the quiz will only accept one classification as the true answer.
        This is a design flaw, so sometimes the player may be unfairly considered wrong.
        There is also a button labeled <b>Change Display</b> to switch between seeing the entire
        picture with a red bounding box around the specific object and a cropped version of the
        picture with only the object in question.

        while the images linked in the dataset are listed to be licensed under the CC BY 2.0 license.
        A button labeled <b>Image Source</b> can be used to go to the original source of the image.
