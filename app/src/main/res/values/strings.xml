    <string name="dataset_information">
        This app uses the Open Images Dataset (Version 6) to get image download URLs, bounding boxes
        to crop the pictures to, and classifications of the bounding boxes.
    </string>

    <string name="instructions_description">
        A random image from the dataset will be chosen and cropped to a bounding box that
        has a classification. You must guess the correct classification out of four options.
        Sometimes, there can be multiple answers (for example, a typical human face can be classified as
        &quot;Face&quot; or &quot;Human Hair&quot;) and the quiz will only accept one classification as the true answer.
        This is a design flaw, so sometimes the player may be unfairly considered wrong.
